# The Problem

Our providers in Dallas, TX need the ability to see nearby shifts available on the ShfitKey platform to plan their work week. Your goal is to build an interface that allows them to accomplish this.

## Details
In `CodingChallenge.xcodeproj`, use `ShiftsView.swift` to get started. Using an address of "Dallas, TX", display one week of nearby shifts that come back from the [Available Shifts API](https://bitbucket.org/shiftkeyllc/ios-coding-challenge/src/master/API-DOC.md) in a list. The shift cell should include information relevant to the provider and when tapped, it should present a modal that will display more information about the shift.

The coding challenge should take around 2-4 hours. The submitted code should reflect what you feel represents your best work.

You should be prepared to talk about your solution in an interview setting.

To start working on the challenge, clone this repo onto your development machine. Commit your changes there and when finished, publish your repo on your public bitbucket or github account.
